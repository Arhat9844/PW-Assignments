    "A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows communication between client and server over the internet, typically using HTTP protocols. It enables access to web-based services and resources. While APIs encompass various interfaces for software communication, Web APIs specifically facilitate interaction over the web, enabling access to web-based services and data."
