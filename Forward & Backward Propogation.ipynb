    "Forward propagation in a neural network is the process of \"passing input data through the network layers to generate an output.\" Each layer's neurons apply weights to the input data, compute a weighted sum, add a bias, and pass the result through an activation function. This sequence continues from the input layer, through hidden layers, to the output layer. The primary purpose of forward propagation is to produce predictions or outputs based on the input data, which are then used to calculate the error during training. This error guides the backpropagation process to adjust weights and biases for better accuracy.\n"

    "Backward propagation, or backpropagation, is a key process in training a neural network. Its purpose is to minimize the error between the network's predictions and the actual target values. This is achieved by adjusting the weights and biases in the network. During backpropagation, the error is computed at the output layer and then propagated backward through the network. Gradients of the error with respect to each weight and bias are calculated using the chain rule of calculus. These gradients are used to update the weights and biases through an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to improve the network's performance.\n"

    "1. **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients can become very small, causing slow learning or making it difficult for the network to learn. This is common with deep networks using sigmoid or tanh activation functions.\n",
