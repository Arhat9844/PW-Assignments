    "# Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and manage multiple processes to achieve parallelism and utilize multiple CPU cores effectively. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, enabling true parallel execution of tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for tasks that are CPU-bound (tasks that require a lot of processing power), such as numerical computations, data processing, and simulations. Multiprocessing allows Python programs to take advantage of modern multi-core processors, thereby improving performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Differences between multiprocessing and multithreading in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execution model:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing: Involves spawning multiple processes that run independently and can execute in parallel on multiple CPU cores. Each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "   - Multithreading: Involves spawning multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources within the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CPU utilization:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing: Utilizes multiple CPU cores effectively, suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "   - Multithreading: Limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, limiting its effectiveness for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Memory:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space, and memory is not shared by default between processes.\n",
    "   - Multithreading: Threads within the same process share memory space, allowing for easy sharing of data but requiring careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use cases:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing: Best suited for CPU-bound tasks, parallel processing, and tasks that benefit from running independently and concurrently.\n",
    "   - Multithreading: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks, such as network communication or disk operations, where threads can overlap I/O operations without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Module used:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing: Utilizes the `multiprocessing` module in Python.\n",
    "   - Multithreading: Utilizes the `threading` module in Python.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "# Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python, specifically `multiprocessing.Pool`, is a convenient abstraction that manages a pool of worker processes. It allows for parallel execution of tasks by distributing them among the available processes in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to simplify the creation, management, and distribution of work across multiple processes, especially when dealing with tasks that can be parallelized, such as independent computations, simulations, or data processing. The pool handles the creation and synchronization of processes, manages task distribution, and gathers results efficiently.\n",
