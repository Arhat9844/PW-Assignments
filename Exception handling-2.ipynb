    "\"\"\"\n",
    "When creating custom exceptions in Python, it is essential to inherit from the Exception class (or one of its subclasses) because Exception serves as the base class for all built-in and user-defined exceptions. By inheriting from Exception, custom exceptions gain essential features like error message handling, traceback generation, and compatibility with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python.\n",
