    "In machine learning, an ensemble technique combines multiple models to improve performance, accuracy, and robustness over individual models. It leverages the strengths and mitigates the weaknesses of each model. Common ensemble methods include bagging (e.g., Random Forest), boosting (e.g., AdaBoost), and stacking. These techniques reduce overfitting, enhance generalization, and provide more reliable predictions by aggregating the results from diverse models.\n",
