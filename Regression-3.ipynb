    "- **Ridge**: Minimizes RSS + penalty term.\n",

    "- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Ridge introduces bias but reduces variance for more reliable estimates.\n"

    "**Ridge Regression** performs well in the presence of multicollinearity by adding a penalty to the size of coefficients, reducing their variance. This stabilizes the estimates, making the model more reliable and less sensitive to highly correlated predictors, unlike OLS which can produce large, unstable coefficients.\n"
