    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning that improves the performance of weak classifiers by combining them sequentially. Each classifier is trained to correct the errors of its predecessor, resulting in a strong overall model. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Boosting reduces bias and variance, enhancing predictive accuracy by focusing on hard-to-classify instances in each iteration.\n",
