It splits the data into subsets based on the feature values, creating branches for each possible outcome. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best divides the data based on a criterion like Gini impurity or entropy. Predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node corresponding to the input feature values."
