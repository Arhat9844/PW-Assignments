    "ANSWER=\n",
    "Part 1: Theoretical Questions\n",
    "Q1: What are the different data structures used in TensorFlow? Give some examples.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow uses several data structures, with the primary ones being:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors: Multidimensional arrays that represent the basic unit of data in TensorFlow. Examples include scalar (0-D tensor), vector (1-D tensor), matrix (2-D tensor), and higher-dimensional tensors.\n",
    "Variables: Mutable tensors that store parameters that can be updated during training.\n",
    "Constants: Immutable tensors that hold fixed values.\n",
    "Datasets: Used for input pipelines, providing an efficient way to handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Constants: Immutable tensors whose values cannot be changed after they are created. They are often used for storing fixed values.\n",
    "TensorFlow Variables: Mutable tensors whose values can be updated. They are used to store model parameters that need to be updated during training.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# TensorFlow constant\n",
    "const = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(\"Constant:\", const)\n",

    "var = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(\"Variable before update:\", var)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Updating the variable\n",
    "var.assign([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "print(\"Variable after update:\", var)\n",

    "Q3: Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Addition: Adding corresponding elements of two matrices.\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication: Performing a dot product between rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.\n",
    "Element-wise Operations: Performing operations on each corresponding element of two matrices, such as element-wise multiplication or division.\n",
