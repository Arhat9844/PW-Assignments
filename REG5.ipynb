    "Elastic Net Regression is a hybrid of Ridge and Lasso Regression, combining L1 and L2 penalties. This regularization technique addresses the limitations of both methods, allowing for variable selection (like Lasso) and handling multicollinearity (like Ridge). By tuning the mixing parameter, it adjusts the relative contribution of L1 and L2 penalties, providing flexibility to handle different types of datasets effectively."

Utilize grid search to define ranges of alpha (mixing parameter) and lambda values. Perform k-fold cross-validation for each combination of alpha and lambda, assessing model performance. Choose the alpha and lambda pair that minimizes cross-validation error, balancing between L1 and L2 penalties for optimal regularization and predictive accuracy."

Coefficients reflect the relationship between predictors and the target variable, but their interpretation considers both penalties' effects. Non-zero coefficients indicate selected features, with their magnitude signifying the strength and direction of the relationship. However, due to the regularization, coefficients may be biased towards zero, requiring cautious interpretation, especially when balancing feature selection and model complexity.\n"
