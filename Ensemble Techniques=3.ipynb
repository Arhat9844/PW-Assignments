    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Learning: It combines predictions from multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data, thereby reducing the variance of the overall model. This ensemble approach helps to mitigate the tendency of individual decision trees to overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): Random Forest Regressor employs bagging, where each decision tree is trained on a random sample of the training data with replacement. This randomness in sample selection reduces the chance of any single decision tree memorizing noise or outliers in the data, leading to more robust and generalized predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: At each node of the decision tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This randomness introduces diversity among the trees in the ensemble, preventing them from all focusing on the same features and relationships. As a result, the model is less likely to overfit to specific features or patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning: While individual decision trees in a Random Forest are allowed to grow deep, the ensemble nature of Random Forest Regressor helps in automatically pruning the trees. Decision trees tend to overfit when they are allowed to grow too deep, capturing noise and irrelevant details in the training data. By averaging predictions from multiple shallow trees, Random Forest Regressor mitigates the risk of overfitting inherent in deep trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error: Random Forest Regressor calculates an out-of-bag (OOB) error estimate during training. This estimate is based on the samples that are not included in the bootstrap sample used to train each tree. The OOB error serves as a cross-validation metric and can be used to monitor the model's performance and detect overfitting"

In other words, the predicted output of each decision tree is considered, and the average of these predictions is taken as the final output of the Random Forest Regressor."
