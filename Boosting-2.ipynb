    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for predictive modeling, particularly in regression tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, in a sequential manner. Each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models by focusing more on the difficult-to-predict cases. The \"gradient\" in the name refers to the optimization process, where the algorithm minimizes a loss function, often the mean squared error, by taking gradient steps. This iterative approach enhances accuracy and robustness, making gradient boosting effective for complex datasets."

    "Instead of trying to fit a single, complex model to the data, Gradient Boosting starts with a simple model and iteratively improves it. Each subsequent model focuses on the residual errors (the differences between the predicted and actual values) of the combined previous models.\n",
    "Gradient Descent Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"gradient\" in Gradient Boosting refers to gradient descent, an optimization technique. The algorithm minimizes a specified loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression) by taking steps in the direction that reduces the error the most.\n",
    "Each new model is added in the direction that most reduces the loss, analogous to taking steps downhill in gradient descent.\n",
    "Weighted Ensemble:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weak learner is weighted according to its contribution to reducing the overall error. The predictions of these learners are combined, typically in a weighted sum, to form the final prediction.\n",
    "The learning rate parameter controls the contribution of each new model, preventing overfitting by scaling the step size of the gradient descent process.\n",
    "Model Flexibility and Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining multiple simple models, Gradient Boosting can capture complex relationships in the data while maintaining flexibility.\n",
    "Regularization techniques such as limiting the depth of decision trees or using shrinkage (via the learning rate) help prevent overfitting.\n",

    "This could be as simple as predicting the mean of the target variable for all instances.\n",
    "Compute residuals:\n",
