    "# Q1: What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors\n",
    "Answer=\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "An Exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. \n",
    "Exceptions are typically errors caused by conditions that arise during the execution of a program, such as dividing by zero, accessing an invalid index, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors, on the other hand, are errors in the syntax of the program code. These are detected during the parsing of the code before the program is run.\n",
    "They are caused by incorrect syntax, such as missing colons, indentation errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Syntax Error:\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")  # Missing colon after the if statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an Exception:\n",
    "x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero error\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example\n",
    "Answer=\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Example of an unhandled exception\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will raise a ZeroDivisionError if b is 0\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, the program terminates and displays a traceback message that shows the type of exception, the error message, and the sequence of calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "In this example, a ZeroDivisionError occurs because we are attempting to divide by zero, and since it is not handled, the program terminates with an error message.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Answer=\n",
    "# Example of try and except statements\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return a / b\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        return \"You cannot divide by zero!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "The try statement is used to wrap a block of code that might raise an exception. The except statement is used to catch and handle the exception.\n",
    "In this example, the ZeroDivisionError is caught and handled by returning a custom message instead of terminating the program.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: Explain with an example: try and else, finally, raise\n",
    "Answer=\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Example of try, else, finally, and raise\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",

    "    print(divide(10, 0))\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\") from e\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "- The else block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
    "- The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
    "- The raise statement is used to raise an exception manually. In this example, a ValueError is raised if any exception occurs in the try block.\n",

    "# Explanation and example of Custom Exceptions\n",
    "Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that extend the Exception class. They are useful when you want to handle specific errors in a way that is meaningful to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to raise a custom exception if a certain condition in your program is not met, which is not covered by the built-in exceptions.\n",
