    "# Q1: What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a process to manage multiple threads concurrently. Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory space, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks and efficient utilization of resources, especially in tasks involving I/O-bound operations or parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to achieve concurrency, improve responsiveness in applications, utilize multicore processors effectively, and handle multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called the `threading` module.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Why is threading module used? Write the use of the following functions (activeCount, currentThread, enumerate).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The `threading` module in Python is used to create and manage threads. Here are the uses of the specified functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `activeCount()`: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. This can be useful to monitor the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "- `currentThread()`: Returns the current Thread object, representing the thread from which this function is called. It provides information about the current thread's state and identity.\n",
    "- `enumerate()`: Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. This includes all threads that have been started and have not yet been joined or terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using activeCount\n",
    "print(f\"Number of active threads: {threading.activeCount()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using currentThread\n",
    "current_thread = threading.currentThread()\n",
    "print(f\"Current thread name: {current_thread.name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using enumerate\n",
    "all_threads = threading.enumerate()\n",
    "print(f\"All threads: {all_threads}\")\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: Explain the following functions (run, start, join, isAlive).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In the context of threading in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `run()`: Defines the code to be executed by a thread when it starts. It's typically overridden in a subclass to implement the specific functionality of the thread.\n",
    "- `start()`: Initiates the execution of a thread. It calls the `run()` method internally to begin the thread's activity.\n",
    "- `join()`: Waits for the thread to complete its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "- `isAlive()`: Returns `True` if the thread is currently executing (active), or `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread {self.name} is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating and starting a thread\n",
    "thread1 = MyThread(\"Thread1\")\n",

    "# Q4: Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares and thread two must print the list of cubes.\n",

    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i*i*i}\")\n",

    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Improved program responsiveness and interactivity.\n",
    "- Efficient utilization of CPU resources, especially in I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "- Simplified program structure for concurrent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Increased complexity in program design and debugging.\n",
    "- Potential for race conditions and synchronization issues.\n",
    "- Overhead due to thread management and synchronization mechanisms.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Deadlock: Deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. In other words, each thread holds a resource and waits for another resource held by another thread, resulting in a standstill.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Race Condition: Race condition occurs when two or more threads or processes access shared data or resources concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing or interleaving of their execution. The result of the execution becomes non-deterministic and depends on the sequence of execution, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
