    "Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization to new data. It is a problem because it results in a model that performs well on the training data but fails in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a credit scoring model, if future payment information (e.g., whether a customer defaulted) is accidentally included in the training features, the model will learn to predict based on this leaked information rather than general patterns, making it useless for predicting future defaults."

    "Proper Data Splitting: Split your data into training, validation, and test sets before any preprocessing to ensure that future information does not influence the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing Pipelines: Use consistent preprocessing pipelines on training and test data separately, applying all transformations (e.g., scaling, encoding) within cross-validation folds to prevent information from leaking across data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Ensure that features used in the model are only from the training period and do not include information that would be unavailable at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Considerations: For time series data, use techniques like time-based splits or walk-forward validation to prevent future information from being used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation in a way that respects the temporal or logical order of data, avoiding any form of shuffling that can cause leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thorough Review: Carefully review the features and the data collection process to ensure no implicit leakage (e.g., derived features that unintentionally include future information)."
